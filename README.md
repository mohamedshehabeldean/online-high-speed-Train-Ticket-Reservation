# online-high-speed-Train-Ticket-Reservation
this project is a wirefram of online high  speed Train Ticket Reservation system using Balsamiq
that follow Eight Golden Role.
## the Eight Golden Rule
- 1. Strive for consistency.
Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations;
identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens;
and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on, should be
employed throughout. Exceptions, such as required confirmation of the
delete command or no echoing of passwords, should be comprehensible
and limited in number.

- 2. Seek universal usability.
Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating
transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges,
disabilities, international variations, and technological diversity each enrich
the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for
novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and
faster pacing, enriches the interface design and improves perceived qualit
- 3. Offer informative feedback.
• For every user action, there should be an interface feedback. For
frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, whereas for
infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial.
Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient
environment for showing changes explicitly.
- 4. Design dialogs to yield closure.
• Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning,
middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of
actions gives users the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a
signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to
prepare for the next group of actions.
• For example let us take an eCommerce website as an example. If you notice
every action that the user does, it gives them a feedback until finally the
process is completed. The user is notified with a message that goes
something like this: "Thank you for purchasing with us."

- 5. Prevent errors.
• As much as possible, design the interface so that users cannot make serious
errors; for example, gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do
not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry fields. If users make an
error, the interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific
instructions for recovery. For example, users should not have to retype an
entire name-address form if they enter an invalid zip code but rather should
be guided to repair only the faulty part. Erroneous actions should leave the
interface state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about
restoring the state.

- 6. Permit easy reversal of actions.
• As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves
anxiety, since users know that errors can be undone, and encourages
exploration of unfamiliar options
• Examples of reversible actions are data entry tasks, the complete
group of actions like entering the name and address block, etc.

- 7.Keep users in control.
• Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of
the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don’t
want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by
tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary
information, and inability to produce their desired result.

- 8. Reduce short-term memory load.
Humans’ limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory (the
rule of thumb is that people can remember “seven plus or minus two chunks” of
information) requires that designers avoid interfaces in which users must
remember information from one display and then use that information on
another display. It means that cellphones should not require reentry of phone
numbers, website locations should remain visible, and lengthy forms should be
compacted to fit a single display.
